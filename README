   This is a State machine for a HPS-FPGA program.
   It is created by Quartus 17.1(Std) in VHDL. 
   Recomend you open it in Quartus 17.1(Std) and you then can simulate it in .vmf file.
   Hope you like it and make it better!!!
   <This vision is definitely just a simple module,actually,you should add some ports which you need,and then it could work better!>
